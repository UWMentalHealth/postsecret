            The original Post-Secret project started in 2005, where people mailed in anonymous 
            postcards with an unspoken and honest secret as contributions to an ongoing art project. 
            While the original project operated as a continuously updating art exhibit both on and 
            offline, numerous other post-secret movements have sprung up, including one right at 
            Waterloo Engineering.

            Here at uWaterloo, we know that there are a lot of things left unsaid, especially about
            mental health. When things get overly stressful, people often turn inward. Post-Secret
            provides a space for students to get thoughts off their chest and out of their minds,
            regardless of what those thoughts contain. By posting them in a public location, this
            term on our virtual wall, students can read and share in the knowledge that others have
            similar thoughts and that they really are not alone.
